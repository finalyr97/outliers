Design of The project
Using preprocessing techniques we are removing outliers and for the obtained data we are applying classification methods to 
check for maximium growth.
The project should be able to determine groth rate of Soybean production and best month for high yield.
Farmer login --> Input new data which will be added to already existing data and viewgraph --> outlier detection using 
regression methods --> o/p will be agraph showing abnormal behavior --> apply classification to predict max growth in a
particular month.
